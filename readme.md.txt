Problem 1: 

This converts the notes app from a standard Javascript application to a Rxjs application using streams and other Rxjs functions


Problem 2: 

This uses Rxjs to count down from the time set in the input boxes. The count down button is disabled when the count down is started
to ensure there are no conflicting count downs. It is displayed in hours minutes and seconds below and stops at 00:00:00.


Problem 3: 

In this, the notes app allows for sub notes to be added,deleted and for subnotes of subnotes to be created.
